# Sports League Player Performance Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores a **sports league dataset** to analyze player performance metrics such as **age** and **player ratings**.  
The goal is to apply basic **data analysis and statistical concepts** to understand how players differ across age groups and performance levels.

It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization — using Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore player data from `sports_league_data.csv`.
- Calculate statistical measures such as **mean** and **standard deviation** for player age and ratings.
- Identify **data ranges within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations** of the mean.
- Visualize distributions and trends for age and player rating.
- Derive basic insights about player performance patterns in the league.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset (`sports_league_data.csv`) contains player information with the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `player_id`     | Unique identifier for each player |
| `age`           | Age of the player |
| `position`      | Playing position (Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper, etc.) |
| `team`          | Team name of the player |
| `games_played`  | Number of games played in the season |
| `player_rating` | Overall performance rating for the season |

> The CSV file is included in this repository for reproducibility.

## 🧠 Key Steps in the Analysis
1. Import data and inspect shape and first few rows.  
2. Compute descriptive statistics for **age** and **player_rating**.  
3. Calculate and interpret **standard deviation intervals** (1σ, 2σ, 3σ).  
4. Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots.  
5. Summarize key takeaways from observed data patterns.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sports-League-Player-Performance-Analysis.git
   cd Sports-League-Player-Performance-Analysis

📊 Results & Insights

The average age of players and player rating were calculated to assess overall league demographics and performance.

Standard deviation ranges helped identify consistency and variability among players.

Visualizations showed patterns of how age and ratings are distributed across the league.

🚀 Future Improvements

Extend the analysis to compare positions (e.g., Forwards vs. Defenders).

Add correlation analysis between games played and performance rating.

Incorporate time-based or team-level trends for deeper insights.

Build a simple dashboard for interactive visualization.
