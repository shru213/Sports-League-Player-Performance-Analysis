# Sports League Player Performance Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores a **sports league dataset** to analyze player performance metrics such as **age** and **player ratings**.  
The goal is to apply basic **data analysis and statistical concepts** to understand how players differ across age groups and performance levels.

It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization — using Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore player data from `sports_league_data.csv`.
- Calculate statistical measures such as **mean** and **standard deviation** for player age and ratings.
- Identify **data ranges within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations** of the mean.
- Visualize distributions and trends for age and player rating.
- Derive basic insights about player performance patterns in the league.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset (`sports_league_data.csv`) contains player information with the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `player_id`     | Unique identifier for each player |
| `age`           | Age of the player |
| `position`      | Playing position (Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper, etc.) |
| `team`          | Team name of the player |
| `games_played`  | Number of games played in the season |
| `player_rating` | Overall performance rating for the season |

> The CSV file is included in this repository for reproducibility.

## 🧠 Key Steps in the Analysis
1. Import data and inspect shape and first few rows.  
2. Compute descriptive statistics for **age** and **player_rating**.  
3. Calculate and interpret **standard deviation intervals** (1σ, 2σ, 3σ).  
4. Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots.  
5. Summarize key takeaways from observed data patterns.
